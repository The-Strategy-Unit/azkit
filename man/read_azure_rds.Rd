\title{Read an rds file from Azure storage}
\usage{
read_azure_rds(container, file, path = "/", info = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{container}{An Azure container object, as returned by \code{\link[=get_container]{get_container()}}}

\item{file}{The name of the file to be read, as a string. NB The file
extension does not need to be included (though it can be). The function
will error if multiple files are somehow matched.}

\item{path}{The path to the directory where \code{file} is located, as a string.
Only needed if \code{file} does not already contain its full path. If file is
just a file name with no path, then provide the path to the directory here.
This must be the full path to the file location, as the function will not
search into subdirectories recursively. Set to \code{"/"} (the root of the
container) by default.}

\item{info}{Boolean. Whether to print user feedback about the file that is
being read. Useful for checking the function is doing what is expected, but
can be turned off with \code{FALSE}. Can be set persistently with the option
"azkit.info". If \code{NULL} then it will default to the value of
\code{\link[rlang:is_interactive]{rlang::is_interactive()}} (ie \code{TRUE} for interactive sessions).}
}
\value{
Data object that was stored in the rds file
}
