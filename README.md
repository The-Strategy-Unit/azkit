R package to handle Azure authentication and basic tasks with blob storage.

## Status

The package is in development.
Please leave an issue or raise a pull request if you have ideas for its
improvement.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{azkit}` with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("The-Strategy-Unit/azkit")
```

## Usage

_To be added._

## Environment variables

To access Azure Storage you need to add some variables to a
[`.Renviron` file][posit_env] in your project.

‚ö†Ô∏èThese values are sensitive and should not be exposed to anyone outside The
Strategy Unit.
Make sure you include `.Renviron` in [the `.gitignore` file][github] for
your project.

Your `.Renviron` file should contain the variables below.
Ask a member of [the Data Science team][suds] for the necessary values.

```
AZ_STORAGE_EP=
AZ_STORAGE_CONTAINER=
```

These may vary depending on the specific container you‚Äôre connecting to.

Please use the [Issues][issues] feature on GitHub to report any bugs, ideas
or problems, including with the package documentation.
